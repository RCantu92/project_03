# Project 03 Proposal

### By Cristian Smoger, Mina Kasrai, and Roberto Cantu

## What:

What our group is proposing is to create a service to tokenize real estate as well as provide either a decentralized marketplace or auction site for the transactions to take place.

## How:

How we will accomplish is by pulling real estate data using APIs and Python as well as create non-fungible ERC721 tokens to then "tie" to the pull real estate data.

We will then program, via smart contracts/Solidity, a decentralized marketplace for the transactions to occur.

## Why:

Our service would be a step in a direction in making the transfer of ownership much more faster and smooth via blockchain and smart contracts.
