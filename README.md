# Project 03 Proposal

### By Cristian Smoger, Mina Kasrai, and Roberto Cantu

## What:

Our group is proposing to create a service to tokenize real estate, as well as provide either a decentralized marketplace or auction site for the transactions to take place.

## How:

We will accomplish this by pulling real estate data using APIs and Python, as well as creating non-fungible ERC721 tokens to "tie" to the pulled real estate data.

We will then program, via smart contracts/Solidity, a decentralized marketplace for the transactions to occur.

## Why:

Our service would be a step in the direction of making the transfer of ownership faster and smoother via blockchain and smart contracts.
